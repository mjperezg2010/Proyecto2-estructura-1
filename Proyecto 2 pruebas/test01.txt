I dream of a woman clothed in white.
She wears wings that shine with golden light.
Her hair is fine like that of an olden wife.
Her eyes hold a vision of the road of life.
She whispers love through the winds.
Then rivers of love flow to my heart and my spirit ascends.
I grow embraced by heavenly heights.
Then glow rays of warmth and light.
I wait only for her touch of the purest.
I fall to her holding of love, of spirit!
We become one in loving presence together.
In love, we come to heaven forever.
Like two doves we sing and dance.
Love of a queen and king.
Love will forever last!
I’ll be the warrior to fight for our love;
We’ll fly together, fly higher than the dove.
I’ll be your wall and shield you from danger;
I’ll take all the pains, for to me they are no stranger.
You’ll be the queen in the kingdom of my heart;
And then I’ll be the king, so we’ll never be apart.
You’ll be my majesty— I will serve you forever;
And for all of the times, I will leave you never
You came into my life like a star
And filled my heart with joy
You took my pain as if it was yours
And gave me love that no one could.
You gave me a shoulder to cry on
You were my pillar when I was falling
You were my strength when I felt low
With your smile, you made my living on earth worthwhile.
A smile is such a lovely thing especially upon your face;
hiding all the sorrows or simply taking their place.
A kindly spoken word means so much when from you,
it comforts my weary heart or when I’m feeling blue.
A song can make our hearts dance in pretty fast-paced clips
when we hear the melody of our loves’ unconquerable grips.
Words could lift my spirits and sweet compassion find;
put your hand in mine alone and peace will fill my mind.
A smile, a word, a song, a look – seem small little things
but when love sparks an action, what blessings they bring!
